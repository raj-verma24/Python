# Python `datetime` Module Exploration

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores Python's `datetime` module in-depth. It covers essential features and concepts related to working with dates and times in Python, including:

- Understanding the core classes: `date`, `time`, `datetime`, `timedelta`, `timezone`
- Handling naive and aware datetime objects
- Working with timezones and managing Daylight Saving Time (DST)
- Practical examples of date and time arithmetic

The notebook serves as both a learning resource and a reference for anyone working with datetime manipulation in Python.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Mastering Date and Time Handling**: Understanding how to manipulate, format, and perform arithmetic operations on dates and times.
- **Timezone Awareness**: Working with both naive and aware datetime objects, and learning how to deal with different timezones.
- **Best Practices**: Following best practices for datetime management in real-world Python applications.

## Features
- Detailed code examples for each class in the `datetime` module.
- Instructions on working with timezones using `pytz` and `zoneinfo`.
- Explanation of naive vs. aware datetime objects.
- A comprehensive notebook to help you grasp all the essential concepts related to datetime handling in Python.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (if using for visualizations)
- `pytz` or `zoneinfo` (for timezone handling)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib pytz
